"""FreeCiv-specific prompt builder for LLM agents.

This module provides a comprehensive system for generating context-aware,
strategy-optimized prompts for different LLM models when playing FreeCiv.

The main components are:
- FreeCivPromptBuilder: Main class for generating model-specific prompts
- ObservationBuilder: Builds strategic summaries and threat assessments
- ContextManager: Compresses observations to fit model token limits
- FreeCivConfig: Configuration constants for all thresholds and limits

Example usage:
    >>> from game_arena.harness.prompts.freeciv_prompts import FreeCivPromptBuilder
    >>> from game_arena.harness.freeciv_state import FreeCivAction
    >>>
    >>> builder = FreeCivPromptBuilder()
    >>> observation = {
    ...     "turn": 42,
    ...     "players": {1: {"score": 340, "name": "Romans"}},
    ...     "units": [{"id": 1, "type": "Warrior", "x": 10, "y": 14}],
    ...     "cities": [{"id": 1, "name": "Rome", "x": 10, "y": 15}]
    ... }
    >>> actions = [FreeCivAction("unit_move", 1, {"x": 11, "y": 14}, {}, "unit")]
    >>> prompt = builder.build_enhanced_prompt(observation, actions, "gpt-5")
    >>> print(len(prompt) < 16000)  # Should be within token limits
    True
