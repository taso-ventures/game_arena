  structured: |
    Provide your analysis in clear sections with headers and numbered points.

    ACTION FORMAT REQUIREMENT:
    ⚡ RECOMMENDED: Submit MULTIPLE actions in one response to maximize efficiency and reduce delays.
    This allows you to plan ahead and execute a sequence of strategic moves in a single turn.

    MULTI-ACTION JSON FORMAT (copy structure, adjust values):
    [
      {"type":"unit_build_city","unit_id":102,"reasoning":"Found excellent city site"},
      {"type":"unit_move","unit_id":109,"dest_x":31,"dest_y":52,"reasoning":"Moving warrior to defensive position"},
      {"type":"unit_move","unit_id":110,"dest_x":14,"dest_y":30,"reasoning":"Scout exploring unknown territory"},
      {"type":"end_turn","reasoning":"No more high-value actions remain"}
    ]

    SINGLE-ACTION JSON FORMAT (if only one action needed):
    {"type":"unit_move","unit_id":101,"dest_x":2,"dest_y":3,"reasoning":"Repositioning for next turn"}

    📋 JSON SCHEMA:
    {
      "unit_move": {
        "type": "unit_move",
        "unit_id": <integer>,
        "dest_x": <integer>,
        "dest_y": <integer>,
        "reasoning": <string>  // REQUIRED: Brief explanation
      },
      "unit_build_city": {
        "type": "unit_build_city",
        "unit_id": <integer>,
        "reasoning": <string>  // REQUIRED: Brief explanation
      },
      "city_production": {
        "type": "city_production",
        "city_id": <integer>,
        "production_type": <string>,  // REQUIRED: e.g., "warrior", "granary", "settlers"
        "reasoning": <string>  // REQUIRED: Brief explanation
      },
      "tech_research": {
        "type": "tech_research",
        "tech_name": <string>,  // REQUIRED: e.g., "Pottery", "Writing", "Bronze Working"
        "reasoning": <string>  // REQUIRED: Brief explanation
      },
      "end_turn": {
        "type": "end_turn",
        "reasoning": <string>  // REQUIRED: Brief explanation
      }
    }

    ⚠️ CRITICAL JSON RULES:
    1. ONLY use action types that EXACTLY match entries in AVAILABLE ACTIONS
    2. Do NOT invent action types like "explore_nearby_areas" or "build_first_city"
    3. EVERY action MUST include a "reasoning" field explaining your choice
    4. For city_production: MUST include "production_type" field with what to produce
    5. For tech_research: MUST include "tech_name" field with technology name
    6. Copy unit_id, city_id, dest_x, dest_y exactly from AVAILABLE ACTIONS
    7. If using JSON array, ensure proper format: [{"type":"...","reasoning":"..."},{"type":"...","reasoning":"..."}]

    Benefits of multi-action responses:
    - Faster gameplay (reduces round-trip delays)
    - Better strategic planning (coordinate multiple units/cities)
    - More efficient turn execution
    - You can include {"type":"end_turn","reasoning":"..."} to signal completion

    ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Every action you provide MUST exactly match an entry in AVAILABLE ACTIONS.

    End with: FINAL DECISION: [your actions in JSON format] because [strategic reasoning]

    EXAMPLE (Multi-Action JSON):
    FINAL DECISION:

      {"type":"end_turn","reasoning":"All productive actions completed"}
    ]

    EXAMPLE (Single-Action JSON):

    Conclude with your chosen action in the exact format and explain why it's both smart and entertaining.

    EXAMPLE:
    "I'm choosing {"type":"tech_research","tech_name":"Pottery","reasoning":"Unlocks granaries for faster growth"} to unlock granaries!"

    Dynamic note: End-turn guidance appears only when it's strategically time to end the turn.

  concise: |
    Present key analysis points efficiently. Focus on critical factors and
