# AGE-161 FreeCiv State Adapter Plan

## Context
- Ticket: AGE-161 – create FreeCiv/OpenSpiel bridge with LLM-ready observations.
- References: Technical Spec §2.1–4.2, CLAUDE.md Python guidance (python-dev-expert), Linear message format samples.

## Sample Packet References (from Technical Spec §4.2)
```json
{"type":"state_update","timestamp":1234567890,"data":{"turn":42,"phase":"movement","observation":{"strategic":{},"tactical":{},"economic":{}},"legal_actions":[]}}
```
```json
{"type":"action","agent_id":"gpt5_player1","data":{"action_type":"unit_move","actor_id":42,"target":{"x":5,"y":7}}}
```

## TDD Work Breakdown
| Step | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Confirm requirements, repo structure, python-dev-expert patterns | ✅ Done | Reviewed CLAUDE.md & Technical Spec.
| 2. Extract sample packets/state schema for fixtures | ✅ Done | Pulled state/action JSON samples above.
| 3. Draft FreeCiv state data fixtures for early/mid/late/combat/production scenarios | ✅ Done | Added fixtures/sample_game_states.json covering five scenarios.
| 4. Write failing tests in `game_arena/harness/tests/test_freeciv_state.py` covering parsing, legal actions, observations | ✅ Done | Added unittest suite asserting parsing, legal actions, observations, apply_action.
| 5. Implement `game_arena/harness/freeciv_state.py` with parsing helpers, `FreeCivAction`, observations | ✅ Done | Added adapter with dataclasses, action helpers, observation builders, caching.
| 6. Add performance-minded optimizations & logging (token budget, <100 ms parsing) | ✅ Done | Added observation caching, action dedupe, token estimate metric.
| 7. Run targeted + full harness tests, adjust as needed | ✅ Done (partial) | Ran `python3 -m unittest game_arena.harness.tests.test_freeciv_state`; full suite blocked by missing deps (absl, pyspiel, chess).
| 8. Update documentation/plan & prepare summary | ✅ Done | Plan maintained through implementation; ready for final summary.

## Next Immediate Action
- Implementation complete; monitor feedback or follow-up requests.
